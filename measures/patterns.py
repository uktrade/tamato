    A pattern that implements suspensions by using an additional code to

    A code that is suspended using this pattern will therefore have two (or

    When the pattern implements the suspension on top of a normal single-measure
    MFN rate, it will terminate the existing measure and replace it with two new
    measures. The pattern can also unsuspend the rate by terminating the two
    additional code measures and replacing them with a single measure.

    If multiple suspensions of this type are applied to the same code, they all
    have an associated MFN measure even though this means duplicating the MFN
    rate.

    If there are multiple patterns of this type applied to the same code,
    different logic applies: adding a new suspension will not terminate the
    existing MFN, and removing the suspension will not restore it. Only the
    first or last suspensions will trigger this behaviour. This means that
