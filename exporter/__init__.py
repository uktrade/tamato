Classes for exposing a number of different output data formats.

Most notably, the exporter module implements the correct output of the
transaction stream into TARIC XML envelopes and handles the process by which
these envelopes are marshalled to CDS.

This module also makes available the objects in the system as an `ActivityPub
<https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/>`_ endpoint.
