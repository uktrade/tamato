    The model is live after the validity start date

    Start and end validity dates are inclusive â€“ meaning that the model is live
    from the beginning of the start date to the end of the end date. A model
    with the same start and end date is therefore live for 1 day. If the
    validity end date is blank (:attr:`valid_between.upper_inf`) then the model
    is live indefinitely after the start date.

    Validity dates can be modified with a new version of a model, so a model
    that initially has a blank end date can be updated to subsequently add one.
