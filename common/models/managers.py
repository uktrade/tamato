    Fixes reverse relations so that always return correct results for versioned
    models.

    For why, see ADR `15. Make reverse relations aware of versions`_.

    This mixin swaps out the foreign keys used by the RelatedManager for
    querying and replaces them with the version group of the instance. The
    apporach is to take over control of the `core_filters` attribute used in
    django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py.

    The attribute is only set in two places – either once for a RelatedManager
    or (in the case of a many-to-many relation) updated in a loop, but the loop
    is only dependent on context provided by the relation itself. Hence it is
    possible to define a property override for `core_filters` that will always
    return the correct result, and ignore anything that it set to the property.
