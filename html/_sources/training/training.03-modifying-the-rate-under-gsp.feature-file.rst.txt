:gherkin-feature-content:`3. Modifying the rate under GSP`
==============================================================================================

The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a tariff regime that gives
favourable access to developing countries. It is an example of a
“preferential regime”, i.e. a mechanism by which tariff rates are lowered
for certain countries in certain circumstances.

GSP is a “unilateral” regime, meaning that the United Kingdom gives
preferential access without expectation of anything in return. This is in
contrast to a “bilateral” regime, in which preferential treatment is applied
to both sides. Read more about `unilateral preferences`_.

The Most Favoured Nation and suspension measures that were created in
earlier scenarios applies to all countries. Handling a preference is similar
but also requires specifying the geographical area that the preference
applies to.

A “geographical area” can be a country, region, trading bloc or other group.

There is no technical difference between a country or a region – it just
reflects the United Kingdom's official view that certain areas are not
recognised as soverign countries.

Groups can contain multiple countries or regions and allow specifying
measures or quotas that should apply to the whole group. Membership of a
group is controlled by a set of dates that specify for what periods a
country or region is a member. Read more about `geographical areas`_.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    :gherkin-tag-keyword:`Tagged:` ui

In this scenario, you will modify the dates on an existing GSP measure to
correct an error. You will first need to find the correct measure and
edit it to correct the dates.

The update is an error correction meaning that the existing measure does
not correctly represent the policy that has been legislated for. The
correct tool to use to make this update is therefore the “Edit measure”
screen.

Note here that we do an update to an existing object using the
``new_version`` call, as opposed to just modifying the attributes and
calling ``save``. The existing version isn't modified and the change
will get included in any updates sent out of the system.
