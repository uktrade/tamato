    Transaction partition field 3 of 3.

    1/3 Create Partition field, with partition defaulting to (1, SEED), as at
    the time of writing most of
    Transactions are from the seed file.

    2/3 Data migration to set Transaction partitions to (2, REVISION) and (3,
    DRAFT). REVISION:  Before this
    migration was written REVISION transactions are contained in workbaskets
    after the first workbasket with approved
    workbasket status. After this migration was written data schemas allow more
    control over SEED / REVISION
    transactions. DRAFT:   Draft Transactions are inferred by checking for
    transactions not in the first workbasket
    that lack an approved workbasket status..

    3/3
    Set the default value to (3, DRAFT)
