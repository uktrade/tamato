TARIC3 Principles
=================

The documents here are from the DG TAXUD TARIC3 specification version 0.47-EN.

As this is a document originally written by the EU, there are some references
which do not make sense in a UK context (such as references to "Member States"
or "the Commission"). These have been retained as-is to most accurately
describe the original intention of the specification.

There is also documentation that is not relevant to the UK Tariff and its
ystems (such as the documentation on EDIFACT). These are retained for 
completeness and potential future interest.
