Library XML functions.

TODO â€“ should these be part of Django? I read somewhere that XML didn't used to
be included by default in most Postgres installations which is why Django chose
not to include these alongside their JSON counterparts. Is that still true? If
not, should we be opening a PR to merge the XML functions in?
