    Return a set of routes auto-generated from the passed views module, based on
    a set of conventions for TrackedModels.

    This will attempt to create routes for the paths listed in BULK_ACTIONS and
    OBJECT_ACTIONS, for both a root record and a description record if the
    `description_detail` is passed. Any views that aren't implemented for the
    passed views module are ignored.

    The conventions are:

    * View classes in the views module begin with the singular of the app name
      (additional_codes -> AdditionalCode)
    * View classes in the views module end with one of the keys of BULK_ACTIONS
      or OBJECT_ACTIONS
    * The view class should be mapped to a URL that is the corresponding value
      of BULK_ACTIONS or OBJECT_ACTIONS
    * OBJECT_ACTIONS have URLs that are prefixed with a `detail_pattern`
    * Subrecords have URLs that are prefixed with both `subrecord` patterns
    * The name of the path is the same as the URL, apart from if the URL is
      blank, in which case it is the lowercase of the action key.

    E.g. when passed `additional_codes.views` with the detail_pattern
    `<sid:sid>`, will return routes for:

    * Name "additional_code-ui-list" mapped to URL "" using view
      `AdditionalCodeList`
    * Name "additional_code-ui-detail" mapped to URL "<sid:sid>/" using view
      `AdditionalCodeDetail`
    * Name "additional_code-ui-update" mapped to URL "<sid:sid>/edit/" using
      view `AdditionalCodeUpdate`
